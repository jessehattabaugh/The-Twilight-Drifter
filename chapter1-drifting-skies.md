# Chapter 1: Drifting Skies

Clouds boiled gently on the horizon, perpetually half-lit beneath the endless orange glare of the sun. The Drifter paused, feeling the rhythmic pulse of wind shift subtly beneath the shimmering scales that armored their form. Slit-pupiled eyes, vast and reflective like polished obsidian orbs, narrowed against the ultraviolet gleam. The Drifter moved with practiced caution, sinewy limbs effortlessly navigating the wind-smoothed stones of the terminator's boundary. Each step fell into harmony with the endless storms that cycled predictably—life here counted days in gusts, breaths measured by clouds.

A sudden burst of winged creatures—thin membranes stretched taut over hollow bones—lifted from beneath a cliffside shelter. They danced upwards, dipping and swirling along the edge of twilight, ultraviolet patterns flashing against the sky in secret languages. The Drifter listened with a silent flicker of sensitive membranes, absorbing the soft resonances of their echolocation.

Something stirred uneasily on the wind—a subtle vibration beneath perception, an irregularity in the eternal, predictable rhythm. The Drifter hesitated, muscles tightening. It had felt this irregularity before, but never so strongly. Something beneath the sands was waking.

With a last glance toward the distant ring-shaped settlements, shimmering like beads along the terminator, the Drifter stepped forward into the wilderness, the hot breath of an endless day whispering secrets of danger and promise ahead.

The Drifter had ridden the winds for twelve storm cycles, feeling the gentle push of thermal currents against the sail-like membranes extended from their back. These were dangerous times to travel. The Cold Push was coming. It happened every thirty-six cycles when the frozen air from the dark side billowed violently across the terminator, bringing death to anything caught unprepared.

The Cold Push had taken everything once. It would not again.

The Drifter retracted the sail membranes, folding them against the ridged spine that ran from neck to tail. The scales along their shoulders rippled slightly, adjusting to the change in temperature as they descended toward a jagged outcropping of stone. The formation jutted from the sand like the broken teeth of some long-dead beast, offering shelter from the wind's relentless scrutiny.

Landing with practiced grace, the Drifter's clawed feet found purchase on the weathered stone. A quick flick of a forked tongue tested the air. Grit. Salt. The lingering electricity of a storm passed. And something else—something wrong.

The Drifter's broad-brimmed head covering, woven from the dried fibers of terminator plants and stained deep crimson with mineral dyes, kept the worst of the ultraviolet rays at bay. Beneath it, a mesh of protective fabric wrapped around their neck and shoulders, further shielding sensitive membranes. At their sides hung twin blades, curved like the claws of the great sand scythes that hunted the dune seas. They'd been useful often enough.

The satchel slung across their back contained the collected necessities of survival: dried food, water bladders, navigation tools, trading goods, and a handful of treasured items salvaged from what remained of home. Not much, but enough. It had to be.

A faint tremor ran through the stone beneath the Drifter's feet. Not the usual geological shifting that marked the terminator region, but something different. Rhythmic. Almost like a pulse.

The Drifter crouched low, pressing a sensitive palm to the rock, feeling the vibrations more clearly. The strange rhythm continued, growing slightly in intensity, then fading again. The winds above seemed to respond, swirling in patterns the Drifter had never witnessed before in all their cycles of riding the storm currents.

The air grew heavy with charged particles. A telltale sign of disruption in the normal flow between hot and cold sides of the world. But this was too early for the Cold Push. Something else drove these changes.

Disturbing the predictable was dangerous. The Drifter had seen it before—settlements built too close to unstable geothermal vents, nomadic tribes who ignored the warning signs of coming storms. They didn't last long. Nature had its rhythms here, brutal as they might be. Those who survived learned to read them, respect them, move with them.

This disruption was different. Unnatural.

The Drifter straightened, unfolding to their full height. The atmospheric weight increased, pressure building like the moments before a great storm. Except no storm came. Instead, the skies above began to shimmer in ways the Drifter had never seen—ribbons of light chasing each other through the clouds, dancing like the mating displays of the great wind whales that sometimes passed overhead during migration seasons.

Beautiful, but wrong. Every instinct the Drifter possessed screamed danger.

A sharp crack split the air as a bolt of energy shot across the sky, connecting clouds that should never have touched. The Drifter's membranes flared in response, sensing electromagnetic shifts powerful enough to disrupt the delicate navigational systems of any creature evolved to ride these skies.

If these disruptions continued, the great migrations would fail. The wind sailors would lose their way. The food chains that sustained the terminator settlements would collapse.

And if they collapsed before the Cold Push came...

The Drifter didn't need to finish the thought. Death would ride the winds into every settlement along the twilight band.

With a practiced motion, the Drifter adjusted the protective coverings, securing them against the increasingly erratic winds. The obsidian eyes scanned the horizon, picking out landmarks, calculating distances and routes. The nearest ribbon city lay perhaps three storm cycles east—if the winds held true, which seemed increasingly unlikely.

A decision formed. The news of these disruptions needed to reach ears that might understand them. The Drifter had connections in Skyhaven, tenuous as they might be. Old debts, owed and owing. Scientists who studied the weather patterns, historians who kept the long memory of the terminator's moods.

The Drifter unfolded the sail membranes once more, feeling them stretch taut, sensitive nerve endings reading the shifts and currents in the air. With one powerful leap, they were airborne, catching an updraft that spiraled along the edge of a thermal boundary.

Below, the ground trembled again, more violently this time. A plume of dust erupted from a patch of sand, twisting upward like a solid thing, writhing against the backdrop of the eternal sunset.

Something was coming. Something from below.

The Drifter banked hard, riding a crosscurrent away from the disturbance. The journey to Skyhaven would be dangerous, perhaps impossible if these atmospheric anomalies continued to worsen. But few other options presented themselves.

As the sun hung motionless in its eternal position, casting long shadows across the terminator's edge, the Drifter rode the currents higher, scanning constantly for signs of other disruptions ahead.

In the distance, where the light of the sun met the endless dark of the night side, a wall of clouds began to form. Not the normal storm boundaries that marked weather cycles, but something larger, more ominous.

Was this the Cold Push coming early? Impossible. The cycles had been reliable for thousands upon thousands of turns. Yet the evidence flew in the face of certainty.

The Drifter's membranes flexed, taking in more information from the electromagnetic fields around them. The usual patterns were fracturing, splitting into chaotic swirls that made navigation increasingly treacherous.

A sharp pain lanced through the Drifter's sensing organs as another burst of unnatural energy cascaded across the sky. Their flight faltered, sail membranes contracting involuntarily against the assault.

For a heart-stopping moment, the Drifter plummeted, the ground rushing up to meet them with unforgiving speed. At the last possible instant, the membranes snapped open again, catching enough air to soften the landing on a rocky outcrop.

The impact still hit hard. The Drifter rolled, distributing the force across armored scales, coming to rest against a wind-carved boulder. Pain radiated from an injured limb, but nothing appeared broken. Lucky.

The Drifter rose slowly, testing each limb, flexing membrane edges to ensure they remained functional. The pain would pass. It always did.

What wouldn't pass was the growing certainty that something fundamental had changed in the world. The rhythm was broken. The predictable had become unpredictable.

In the distance, the lights of a small outpost flickered against the twilight backdrop. Not Skyhaven, but perhaps a place to gather information, to learn if others had noticed these disruptions.

The Drifter adjusted course and began moving toward the lights, staying low, using the terrain for cover. Old habits. Trust came dear in the terminator lands. Information was currency, weakness was death, and strangers were trouble until proven otherwise.

The anomaly in the sky pulsed again, sending another wave of distortion through the air. This time, the Drifter was prepared, membranes folded tight against the sensory onslaught.

Whatever was happening, whatever was coming, the Drifter would survive. That's what drifters did. They adapted. They endured.

They drifted on, no matter what storms lay ahead.
