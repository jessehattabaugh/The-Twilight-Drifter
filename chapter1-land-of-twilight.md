# Chapter 1: Land of Twilight

Kael paused at the crest of the ridge, leaning on his walking staff as he surveyed the landscape before him. The eternal twilight cast long shadows across the rolling plains, painting the tall grasses in hues of amber and crimson. Behind him lay the forests of the Deep Twilight, dense and familiar. Ahead stretched the unknown—the outer reaches of the terminator band where the comfortable balance between light and dark grew increasingly precarious.

He'd never ventured this far from home before. No one from his settlement had, not in generations.

They had no need to. The Deep Twilight provided everything—temperate weather, fertile soil, protection from the harsh extremes that defined the rest of this world. Their ancestors had chosen wisely when they settled in that perfect middle ground, where the angle of the never-moving sun provided just enough warmth and light for crops to flourish.

But that was changing now.

Kael shifted the weight of his pack, feeling the strain in his shoulders. Three cycles of travel had taken their toll. He carried little—dried meat from the plains-grazers, a water skin, his father's hunting knife, a bundle of medicinal herbs wrapped in cured leather, and a pouch containing seeds from every crop his people cultivated. The last of it, perhaps. The heritage of an entire community, reduced to what one man could carry on his back.

The cold had come first—subtle warnings in the form of morning frosts that lingered too long, withering the tender shoots of the spring planting. Then the wind patterns changed, bringing icy gusts from the dark side of the world, where eternal night ruled and nothing lived. The elders said it was temporary—a minor shift in weather that would soon correct itself. Their people had endured such changes before.

But this was different. Kael had felt it in his bones, seen it in the migration patterns of the herd beasts, read it in the worried furrows that deepened on his father's brow when he thought no one was watching.

"We need to know what lies beyond," Kael had argued at the council gathering. "If this cold continues, we'll need new lands, new patterns of living."

Most had dismissed him. A few, including the Chief Speaker, had listened. In the end, they had chosen him—young enough to endure the journey, old enough to be trusted with the future of their people.

"Go," the Chief Speaker had told him. "Find what awaits us. Return with knowledge that will save our people."

Simple words. Impossible task.

Kael took a deep breath and began his descent into what his people called the Scorchlands. No man with sense ventured far into that merciless expanse where the eternal sun burned without pity. The path, such as it was, wound down through rock formations twisted into fantastic shapes by the relentless wind. Even here, at the very edge of that sun-blasted hell, the air shimmered with heat that pressed against him like a physical force. The vegetation grew sparser but more stubborn than in his homeland—thick-leaved plants with deep roots and waxy surfaces that reflected the harsh light, their forms hunched and gnarled like old warriors who refused to die. Old-timers spoke of foolhardy travelers who'd ventured too far into the Scorchlands, their dried husks found weeks later, eyes cooked in their skulls. Kael hoped they were just fireside tales.

The angle of the sun never changed here, not as it did in other worlds his ancestors had spoken of in their stories. Instead, it hung forever at the same point in the sky—a bloated orange orb that dominated half the horizon. The land lived in perpetual dusk, neither fully in light nor completely in darkness. A world of eternal twilight.

Kael had been traveling for half a day when he noticed the change in the sky. The usual cloud patterns had shifted, forming strange whorls and eddies unlike anything he'd seen before. Energy rippled through them, visible even to his eyes, which lacked the specialized adaptations of creatures born to these outer regions.

Something was wrong. The wrongness vibrated in the air, prickled along his skin, set his teeth on edge.

He quickened his pace, moving from the exposed ridge down toward a cluster of rock formations that might offer shelter. Whatever was happening above, he wanted solid stone between himself and the sky before it intensified.

The wind rose sharply, whipping sand against his face. Kael pulled his protective scarf higher, shielding his eyes and mouth from the grit. The storm—if that's what it was—had come on with unnatural speed.

A flash of light split the clouds, followed by a sound like tearing fabric. Not thunder—something different, something that made the very air seem to shudder. Kael broke into a run, abandoning caution in favor of speed.

The rocks ahead offered a shallow cave, little more than an overhang really, but better than nothing. He lunged for it just as another energy pulse ripped through the sky.

From his shelter, Kael watched in awe and terror as the sky convulsed. Lightning danced between clouds that spiraled like whirlpools in the air. The very fabric of the world seemed to be coming apart above him.

Then he saw it—a dark shape against the churning clouds. Something large, with wings or sails extended, riding the violent currents. Its movements were graceful at first, then suddenly erratic. It fought against forces Kael couldn't comprehend, its body twisting in ways that spoke of desperate struggle.

The creature fell. Even from this distance, Kael could see the moment when control was lost, when gravity reclaimed what the wind had briefly borrowed.

Impact raised a plume of dust perhaps half a mile distant. Kael hesitated only briefly before gathering his gear. The storm was passing as quickly as it had formed, the unnatural energy dissipating, though the clouds still moved in unfamiliar patterns.

He shouldn't get involved. His mission was clear—explore, observe, return with information. Nothing about rescuing fallen sky-creatures.

But he moved toward the impact site anyway. Curiosity, perhaps. Or something deeper—a recognition that in this vast, unforgiving world, the offering of help was what separated thinking beings from mere animals.

The trek took longer than expected. Distance was deceptive in the unchanging light, and the terrain more challenging than it had appeared from his vantage point. By the time Kael reached the small impact crater, a full time-cycle had passed.

The creature lay motionless in the depression its fall had created. Sand had already begun to drift across its form, as if the desert were eager to claim this new addition. From a cautious distance, Kael studied what he had found.

It was unlike anything he'd seen before—clearly not of his kind, though it had two arms, two legs, and a head covered by what appeared to be a broad-brimmed hat of deep crimson. Its body was covered in iridescent scales that shifted color with each subtle movement of the wind. Most remarkable were the membrane-like structures that extended from its back, now folded and partially buried in sand. Wings, or something similar.

A flying creature, then. One of the legendary Drifters that his people spoke of in whispered tales around evening fires? They were said to be solitary, dangerous, alien in thought and purpose. Some stories painted them as wise guardians of the sky; others as ruthless predators who swooped down to carry off the unwary.

The truth, as always, probably lay somewhere between.

Kael approached cautiously, one hand on his knife. The creature showed no sign of consciousness, but its chest rose and fell in shallow movements. Alive, then. Injured, certainly. Dangerous? Unknown.

At its side hung twin curved blades, their edges gleaming dully in the twilight. A warrior, or at least someone prepared for violence. Kael stopped just beyond arm's reach, considering his options.

He could leave it here. Continue his journey. Whatever had happened to this being wasn't his concern. His people were waiting for his return, for the knowledge he was sent to gather.

Or he could help. Bind its wounds if possible. Offer water, food, shelter until it recovered—or died, if its injuries proved fatal.

The creature's chest heaved suddenly, a rattling sound escaping from what must be its throat. One clawed hand twitched, then fell still again.

Kael made his decision. Carefully, he knelt beside the fallen Drifter.

"I don't know if you can understand me," he said softly, "but I'm going to try to help you."

He reached for his water skin, wondering if this strange being could even drink the same water his people did, or if its needs were as alien as its form.

Only one way to find out.
