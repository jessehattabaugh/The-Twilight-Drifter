# Prologue: Harbinger of Change

Clouds boiled gently on the horizon, perpetually half-lit beneath the endless orange glare of the sun. The winged figure paused at the edge of a wind-smoothed cliff, shimmering scales reflecting the twilight glow. Obsidian eyes narrowed against the harsh ultraviolet rays that bathed the boundary between eternal day and endless night.

A sudden burst of small creatures—thin membranes stretched taut over hollow bones—lifted from beneath a cliffside shelter. They danced upwards, dipping and swirling along the edge of twilight, patterns flashing against the sky in secret languages.

Something stirred uneasily in the air—a subtle vibration, an irregularity in the eternal rhythm. The creature's sail-like membranes extended from its back, catching the thermal current that rose from the sun-baked rocks below. With one fluid motion, it launched from the cliff edge, soaring upward into the churning skies.

The figure had been riding these currents for many cycles, a solitary sentinel watching the boundary where scorching light met freezing darkness. Locals in the scattered settlements called such creatures Drifters—mysterious, rarely-seen beings who navigated the wild winds that few others dared to challenge.

This Drifter banked sharply as the wind pattern suddenly shifted. Above, the familiar cloud formations began to twist in unfamiliar ways. Lightning crackled where no lightning should be, arcing between cloud masses that should never have touched.

The atmospheric disturbance intensified. Energy pulsed across the sky in waves, disrupting the natural flow of wind and warmth. The Drifter's flight became erratic, its membrane wings contracting and expanding in desperate attempts to maintain stability.

A violent surge of energy cascaded through the clouds. The Drifter's body contorted as if struck by an invisible force. Its graceful flight faltered. For a terrible moment, the creature hung suspended, sail membranes twitching uselessly.

Then it fell.

Down through layers of swirling cloud. Down past the jagged outcroppings of stone. Down toward the endless sands that stretched along the twilight band.

The impact sent a plume of dust skyward. The Drifter's body lay motionless, crimson head covering askew, twin curved blades still sheathed at its sides. Blood the color of burnished copper seeped into the sand.

Above, the sky continued its unnatural dance, energy ribbons chasing each other through clouds that boiled with increasing fury. Whatever force had struck down the mighty Drifter was growing stronger.

And somewhere, deep in the fertile heart of the terminator lands, a cold wind began to blow where no cold should be—whispering of changes to come.
